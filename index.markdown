<p><img class="align-right round" src="/images/me.jpg" alt="Michael Burke headshot" width="200" height="200">
I am a <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/michael-burke-2">Senior Lecturer in Robotics and AI at Monash University</a> in Melbourne, Australia and an Honorary Fellow at the University of Edinburgh. Prior to this, I was a <a href="http://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/">Research Associate at the Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour at the University of Edinburgh</a>, which I joined after returning to academia in 2018, following about 7 years of industry R&D. Before this, I led Robotics and AI at the <a href="https://www.csir.co.za/mobile-intelligent-autonomous-systems-mias-laboratory">Mobile Intelligent Autonomous Systems group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)</a>, South Africa. I have a PhD in statistical signal processing from the University of Cambridge (2012-2016), a Masters of Science in electronic engineering from Stellenbosch University and a Bachelors in electronic engineering from the University of Pretoria.</p>
<p>At Monash, I teach computer vision (ECE4076) to undergraduate and masters students, and integrated design (ECE4191) where students design and build robots to complete an annual challenge. I take on a service role in graduate student support, and play a role in policy development around AI in education.</p>

## Join us
<p>PhD students interested in working with me on probabilistic machine learning and inference for robotics (imitation, learning from demonstration, representation learning for robotics, learning-based robot control) should  <a href="https://www.monash.edu/engineering/future-students/graduate-research/how-to-apply"> <strong> follow this process to apply </strong></a>. My supervision load is typically quite full, but always open to discussing projects aligned with my research interests. </p>

## What we do

<p>This website lists projects I've worked on in a variety of areas covering robotics, computer vision and machine learning, particularly the probabilistic kind. I have also been involved in a wide range of contract R&amp;D projects covering areas ranging from agriculture to mining, but sadly I can't show these off here. My core interest is in <em>control as inference</em>, a field of robot learning where we frame robot control as an inference problem. A key emphasis of our work is that we view neural networks as models, and try to think deeply about the architectural choices we make when using them.</p>
