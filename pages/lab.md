### Industry Partners and Funders

Our lab is currently supported by 

* ARC Discovery Project ($640k) Skillphabets: Teaching robots new skills by reducing information asymmetry.
* ARC Discovery Project ($615k) Human models for accelerated robot learning and human-robot interaction.
* ARC Linkage Project ($1.2 M) Intelligent Robotics for Pharmaceutical Formulation Development.

Students are generally supported by central Australian government and university scholarships. We also also collaborate with industry partners like CSL-Behring, Proa and Omnia.
