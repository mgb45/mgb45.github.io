### Industry Partners and Funders

Our lab is currently supported by 

* ARC Linkage Project ($1.2 M) Intelligent Robotics for Pharmaceutical Formulation Development
* ARC Discover Project ($615k) Human models for accelerated robot learning and human-robot interaction.

Students are generally supported by central Australian government and university scholarships. We also also collaborate with industry partners like CSL-Behring, Proa and Omnia.
